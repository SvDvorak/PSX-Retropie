# PSX Retropie

For my brother's birthday I wanted to make something special. As the original Playstation is near to his heart I converted an old one to hold a Raspberry Pi, with completely functional controller ports, power & reset buttons, power LED and USB ports in the memory slots.

This repository contains the scripts and Raspberry Pi configuration steps I used.

DISCLAIMER: It was more than 5 years ago I wrote these scripts and the setup config. I leave no guarantees that they'll work for you.

For the physical parts:

The model of the PSX is an SCPH-5552 (european). 

NOTE: Many of these models are based on both parts I already had on hand and others I've bought (some of which I've listed below). This print requires you to modify the PSX case itself quite a bit to make them fit (USB ports, cooling fan and more). This is not a straight & easy build but it might make a good start.

These were some of the parts I've bought for this project from a swedish electronics store, some I already had on hand.

- Found a short HDMI micro male to HDMI female in a local shop
- Used an old PSU fan for cooling (12V but running at 5V, slowly)
- LED's are I believe 5mm ones, unsure of strength
- Assorted USB & network cables for cabling

The Raspberry Pi mount I created is a remix of this one:
